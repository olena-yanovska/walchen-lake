### Slider
To implement sliders on the first screen the swiper was used. It provides a seamless user experience, allowing users to interact with the sliders easily.

### Hover Effects
All elements on the landing page have hover effects, providing a more engaging user experience. When a user hovers over an element, it triggers an animation or effect, providing visual feedback to the user.
