# The Walchen lake Landing Page

This landing page is a great example of how HTML and SCSS can be used to create an engaging and interactive website. With the addition of swiper and hover effects, the page provides a seamless user experience that keeps visitors engaged and interested.

## Demo
Here is a working live demo :  https://olena-yanovska.github.io/walchen-lake/


### Sliders
To implement sliders on the page, the swiper was used. The library provides a seamless user experience, allowing users to interact with the sliders easily.

### Hover Effects
All elements on the landing page have hover effects, providing a more engaging user experience. When a user hovers over an element, it triggers an animation or effect, providing visual feedback to the user.
